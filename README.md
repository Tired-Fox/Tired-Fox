## Notable projects

I don't have many projects to show off, yet, but I have a few work in progress projects that I'm excited for.

1. **[Null](https://github.com/Tired-Fox/lang-null)**
    * Doesn't exist? Nope! This is a programming language that I started making from scratch to learn the low level process of how programming languages work.
2. **[Story Tree](https://github.com/StoryTreeGames)**
    * This is fairly early, but I have always enjoyed created games. So in spite of everyone saying it is insane, I decided to start creating a collection of libraries to create my own game engine.
3. **\*To Be Named\* (Game Game Website)**
    * To continue on with my love for videogames and their development, I started prototyping a website that contains a hub for game jams. The jams themselves are not hosted on this site. Instead it handles events and collecting general information into a single location.
4. **[My Blog](https://tired-fox.vercel.app/blog)**
    * I haven't been a person that is always on social media, let alone someone who uses it. A goal of mine is to change this in a positive and productive way. I plan to "blog" about my thoughts and findings while creating my projects. This does two things: serve as a reference to look back on in the future, and a detailed process on how I create to inspire others.

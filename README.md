# Welcome!

Hello to all developers ðŸ’» and those of you striving to keep learning ðŸ“–.

I have a passion for all aspects of programming and hold motivation to keep learning new topics. My skills are constantly evolving and I strive to learn more about all areas of programming.

Check out my projects and join me on my quest to learn as much as possible about programming.

## 2023 Goals:
- [ ] Create a personal website with `Astro` and `Solid.js`
- [ ] Finalize major releases for my python repos: `Mophidian`, `phml`, `watchserver`, `tcfg`, and `saimll`
- [ ] Learn Linear (task management)
- [ ] Learn Neovim
- [ ] Become proficient in Rust and Typescript
- [ ] Start new rust browser project. Will involve new inavative feature exploration. Inovative for looks and native features.
- [ ] Stream my projects as they are being developed

## Notable Projects:
- [**Mophidian**](https://github.com/Tired-Fox/Mophidian): A static site generator made with pure python and a new python templating language [phml](https://github.com/Tired-Fox/phml)
- [**phml**](https://github.com/Tired-Fox/phml): A new python templating language inspire from Vue.js, React.js, and other modern JS frameworks.
- [**saimll**](https://github.com/Tired-Fox/saimll): A python utility library that focuses on a new inline markup language for coloring terminal outputs with ansi
- [**tcfg**](https://github.com/Tired-Fox/tcfg): A python library focused around configuration. Has `yaml`, `toml`, and `json` built it with the ability to be extended. The library also boasts type checking and default values along with class/member syntax.
- [**watchserver**](https://github.com/Tired-Fox/watchserver): A python library that implements a live server that watches for file changes and automatically refreshes html pages. It has features such as ignore patterns, opening the server in the browser automatically, and the ability to create custom callbacks and refresh logic for file creation, updating, and deletion.
